# Temperature-and-Humidity-Monitor-System-Using-Blynk-app


Used a DHT 11 sensor to be uploaded on my Blink app which indicates a warning via a notification after a certain Limit of value of Temperature and Humidity.
Here I have used a Nodemcu(Esp8266) microcontroller which is having a Wifi Connectivity .
I have used Blynk app ,which is connected via my (same wifi connection) with Nodemcu.

This project works on client Server Model

Here my microcontroller Nodemcu acts as a client to Post data i.e Temperature and humidity on Blynk servers and a user of Blynk app is able to retrieve that data.
